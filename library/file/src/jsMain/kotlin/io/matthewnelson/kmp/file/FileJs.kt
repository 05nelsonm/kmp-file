/**
 * Helper for calling externally defined code in order to propagate a proper
 * JS [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).
 * On Kotlin/Js this simply calls [block], but on Kotlin/WasmJs [block] is
 * wrapped in a function call and run from Js within its own try/catch block. If
 * an Error was caught, it is returned to Kotlin code, converted to [Throwable],
 * and then thrown.
 *
 * **NOTE:** This should only be utilized for externally defined calls, not general
 * kotlin code.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 *     internal external interface SomeJsThing {
 *         fun doSomethingFromJs(): Int
 *     }
 *
 *     fun executeFromKotlin(thing: SomeJsThing): Int {
 *         return try {
 *             jsExternTryCatch { thing.doSomethingFromJs() }
 *         } catch(t: Throwable) {
 *             println(t.errorCodeOrNull)
 *             throw t
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * @see [errorCodeOrNull]
 * @see [toIOException]
 *
 * @throws [Throwable] If [block] throws exception
 * */
